# Check lines as REFERENCES, not filters. A check is a benchmark genotype (a released variety,
# a commercial check) that is never crossed: check x check would be a self, which
# ng_make_pairs() does not enumerate, so a check has no variance and can never be a row in the
# cross table. It contributes a scalar per trait, on the same mean_source the cross means use.
# See docs/design/2026-09-03-check-reference-lines-design.md.

# Align a separate check genotype matrix to the marker set already fixed by parent QC. A check
# matrix that silently disagrees on marker set or column order produces a wrong-but-plausible
# reference value, so every disagreement is an error rather than an intersection.
